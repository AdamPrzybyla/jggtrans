Version 2.0.2
-------------

This is mainly bugfix release.

Changes from 2.0.1:

* Presence change notification handling improved. This should fix the
  annoying problem with transport users changing their GG presence
  multiple times when logging in.

* "get roster" doesn't add users to roster any more. There is new
  "import roster" command instead.

* There is an option in registration form allowing to auto-import
  userlist from GG server.

* Should now link on FreeBSD and other OSes without gettext in libc.

Version 2.0.1
-------------

This is mainly bugfix release.

Changes from 2.0.0:

* GG number used to register in transport is displayed with the "menu"
  and current settings

* Translation of local messages (log, --help) rewritten so it should
  really work now

* Fixes for bugs in "get roster" code, which caused transport crash or
  disconnection

* Other (minor) bugfixes


Version 2.0.0
-------------

This is a major feature improvement release. It may be not as stable as
1.4.x, but it is much cooler. However most of the new features are only
usable with modern-enough Jabber client.

Changes from 1.4.1:

* Userlist retrieval from GG server.

* Access Control Lists (ACL) may be defined in the configuration file.

* Statistic gathering (JEP-0039) support.

* Administrators (listed in the configuration file) can browse (using
  browse or disco) online users registered in the transport.

* Service discovery (JEP-0030) support.

* Jabber forms (data gathering and reporting, JEP-004) may be used for
  registration, searching and changing transport options.

* All messages generated by the transport (including error messages and
  logs content) maybe translated to user's or admin's favorite language.
  Polish translation is ready.

* GG public directory updates and password change (via the register
  form) work again.

* Several segmentation-fault bugs fixed.

* More GG client versions are now known to the transport.

Version 1.4.1
-------------

Changes from 1.4.0:

* autorestart (after connection to jabber server is broken) fixed.

* fix for automatic server change (now jggtrans should really change
  server, when one doesn't respond)

* searching by email removed (it seems this is not supported any more)

* fixed handling of delayed (stored on GG server) messages

* user settings, like invisible or friends-only, are properly saved now

* detection of new GG client versions

* command list is sent as one message now


-------------

Changes from 1.3.1:

* configurable GG server list.

* support for new GG search protocol. Searching and retrieving user
  information should work again.

* crash caused by invalid registration form fixed.


Version 1.3.1
-------------

Changes from 1.3.0:

* crash caused by empty presence priority (sometimes sent by Exodus) fixed

* pid file is written before privileges are dropped and is removed on exit


Version 1.3.0
-------------

Changes from 1.2.3:

* several (at least 3) segmentation faults fixed

* fixes for some "strange behaviour" in several Jabber clients 

* "friends only" and "invisible" modes (controlled by messages to the
  transport)

* support for user lists stored on GG server started (broken, disabled by
  default)

* restart after connection to Jabber server is broken

* GG client version detection

* pkg-config support for libgadu configure check

Version 1.2.3
-------------

Changes from 1.2.2:

* new character conversion function (instead of sometimes broken
  iconv()). Fixes crashes on invalid characters in GG input.

* jggtrans will now ignore control characters in GG input. These are
  invalid in XML stream
  
* fixes in contact status handling 

Not a change in the program, but important: jabber-gg-project is now
registered on JabberStudio (http://www.jabberstudio.org). This is the
proper place for bug reports and feature requests now.

Version 1.2.2
-------------

Changes from 1.2.1:

* two bugs in vCard and user directory fixed


Version 1.2.1
-------------

Changes from 1.2.0:

* compilation on FreeBSD fixed

* GG status change fixed when no reason string is given

* fixed freeing already free  xmlnode query  while registering.
  Patch by Tomasz Sterna <tomek@smoczy.net>

* added jabber:iq:version jggtrans query support. Psi nicely shows it on
  transport tooltip.
  Patch by Tomasz Sterna <tomek@smoczy.net>


Version 1.2.0
-------------

Changes from 1.1.0:

* updated to new libgadu (works with libgadu-20021205).

* searching works again.

* IP address of active GG user in roster is provided in "About" field of
  user's vCard.

* several memory leaks fixed.

* workaround for buggy support for jabber:iq:gateway in some clients.
  This fixes contact addition problems.


Version 1.1.0
-------------

Changes from 1.0.1:

* presence change reason (status description) support


Version 1.0.1
-------------
This version contains mainly updates for the latest libgadu. 
It works at least with libgadu-20020528.

Changes from 1.0.0:

* new config tags: <gg_server/> and <gg_port/>

* updates for libgadu-20020528


Version 1.0.0
-------------
This version fixes some more bugs. Probably still there are some, but it is
high time to release another version and I don't want to add another ".9" :-)

Changes from 0.9.9:

* just bug fixes


Version 0.9.9
--------------
This version fixes all fatal bugs known to me. If no bug report come this
release will become 1.0.0 soon.

Changes from 0.9.8:

* Timeout and ping interval settings are now included in example config files

* Auto-reconnect to GaduGadu server after connection is broken (<reconnect/>
  option in config file)

* Fixes for some crashes related to user lookup 


Version 0.9.8
--------------
This will be (hopefully) the last one before jabber-gg-transport-1.0.0
It has changed a lot, so don't believe that your old config files will
work :-)


Changes from 0.9:

* Support for <remove/> in registration

* Many bug fixes 

* Don't panic when PONG is not received. It seems GG server doesn't send
  them any more

* Support for system message. They are sent from the agent, not user "0"
  now. And each message is sent only once

* Workarounds for WinJab bugs with child elements of <iq/> 
  (eg. VCARD instead of vCard)

* Browse support

* Changing of uid/gid when started as root (good for init scripts)

* Support for multiple user resources



Version 0.9
--------------
This is the first released version.
