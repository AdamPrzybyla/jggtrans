Version 1.0.1
-------------
This version contains mainly updates for the latest libgadu. 
It works at least with libgadu-20020528.

Changes from 1.0.0

* new config tags: <gg_server/> and <gg_port/>

* updates for libgadu-20020528


Version 1.0.0
-------------
This version fixes some more bugs. Probably still there are some, but it is
high time to release another version and I don't want to add another ".9" :-)

Changes from 0.9.9:

* just bug fixes


Version 0.9.9
--------------
This version fixes all fatal bugs known to me. If no bug report come this
release will become 1.0.0 soon.

Changes from 0.9.8:

* Timeout and ping interval settings are now included in example config files

* Auto-reconnect to GaduGadu server after connection is broken (<reconnect/>
  option in config file)

* Fixes for some crashes related to user lookup 


Version 0.9.8
--------------
This will be (hopefully) the last one before jabber-gg-transport-1.0.0
It has changed a lot, so don't believe that your old config files will
work :-)


Changes from 0.9:

* Support for <remove/> in registration

* Many bug fixes 

* Don't panic when PONG is not received. It seems GG server doesn't send
  them any more

* Support for system message. They are sent from the agent, not user "0"
  now. And each message is sent only once

* Workarounds for WinJab bugs with child elements of <iq/> 
  (eg. VCARD instead of vCard)

* Browse support

* Changing of uid/gid when started as root (good for init scripts)

* Support for multiple user resources



Version 0.9
--------------
This is the first released version.
