		    ===============================
	      (c) 2002 Jacek Konieczny <jajcus@pld.org.pl>

This is external component for Jabber (http://www.jabber.org) server
providing gateway to GaduGadu instant messaging services. GaduGadu is IM
system very popular in Poland.

Sources include example config file (ggtrans.xml), which contains all
configuration instructions. It should be installed in the $sysconfdir
directory (defined by configure script, default: /usr/local/etc). 

To start GaduGadu transport run "jggtrans" binary _after_ starting
jabber server.

Note: you should never run jggtrans as root.

Please report any bugs to me:
